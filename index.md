## Welcome

K2Store is one the most loved simple eCommerce solution that worked based on the famous K2 content construction Kit for Joomla.

### Project Status
After serving the community for well over 5 years, we are **archiving the project**, in favour of our robust eCommerce platform for Joomla - [J2Store](https://www.j2store.org). So there will be no updates or support available for the project. 

We strongly recommend you to switch to J2Store as it is more flexible, offers tons of features. 
NOTE: You will need to re-create your products as Joomla articles because J2Store uses the Joomla articles as products.

### Why the change of heart?

K2Store is developed with the intention of being a simple eCommerce solution. With more and more customers finding it quite handy, people were also looking for more features. While we are already developing J2Store as a full-fledged eCommerce solution, working on almost similar features in K2Store led to quite a lot of duplication - in all fronts. Example: Payment gateways.

Instead of dividing the attention and time between two similar solutions, we decided to continue the development of J2Store and its thriving ecosystem.

Since J2Store already has over 200+ payment gateways, shipping methods and apps, it would be quite beneficial to store owners switching from K2Store. They can now build a robust online business using J2Store and its ecosystem.

### What are the next steps?
If you are running a store with K2Store, please consider switching to J2Store. 
NOTE: You will need to re-create your products as Joomla articles because J2Store uses the Joomla articles as products.
